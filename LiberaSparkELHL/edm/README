This directory contains the EDM
Graphical User Interface for Libera Spark EL/HL.

The start script (start.sh) contains settings
for a particular system configuration. To use the
EDM panels in your system, copy the /panels and /prefs

This GUI works with libera-ioc3.2! The PV database must
contain double PVs (monitor and set).
